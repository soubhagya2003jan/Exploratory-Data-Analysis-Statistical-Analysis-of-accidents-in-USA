#### The goal of this analysis is to explore the U.S. accidents dataset to identify patterns and trends related to accidents across different variables. Specifically, the analysis aims to:

 - Examine the impact of environmental factors such as temperature, wind speed, and visibility on accident occurrences.
 - Identify the distribution of accidents by geographical location, focusing on states and cities with the highest accident rates.
 - Analyze temporal trends, including the frequency of accidents by day of the week, time of day, and month, to uncover peak periods for accidents.
 - Evaluate the severity of accidents in relation to various factors, providing insights for policymakers and safety organizations to improve road safety measures.
